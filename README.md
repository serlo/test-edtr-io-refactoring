Minimal working repository with edtr-io source code that can be used from the frontend.

To build this repo, run `npm install` and `npm run build`. This will invoke tsc.

To consume this repo, add this to your `package.json`:

```
"test-edtr-io": "serlo/test-edtr-io-refactoring"
```

Only consumer at the time is frontend.
